Creating a book recommendation system webpage.

Webpage functionalities:
Build users profile
Suggest books for a user based on the users profile. 

Users Profile
The users profile should be built of five books the user selects and rates.

For non-reader users:
The user would be made to choose genres they are interested in and the website would provide the highest rated books in those genres.


For this to work, I'd need to:
1. Clean and create a sparse matrix from the book ratings.
2. K-Nearest model fitting.
3. Figure out how to add the user profile to the sparse matrix.
Option A: Add it to the dataset before creating the sparse matrix.
Option B: Find the person most similar to the user in the dataset, and use that instead (Last resort).


For the webpage:
1. Create a list of all the books.
2. use a hashmap to convert the chosen books to the respective Ids.
